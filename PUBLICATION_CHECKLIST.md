# GitHub Publication Checklist

This checklist ensures WeatherCop is ready for public release on GitHub.

## Publication Scope

**GitHub Publication:** ‚úÖ READY
**PyPI Publication:** ‚ùå BLOCKED (VG dependency must be on PyPI first)

## ‚úÖ Critical Blockers for GitHub (RESOLVED)

- [x] **No large binary files committed** - Excluded via .gitignore (849MB MKL libraries, 3.7GB cache)
- [x] **No hardcoded personal paths** - Made configurable via environment variables
- [x] **No personal credentials** - Email changed to GitHub noreply
- [x] **No personal configuration files** - Moved to examples/
- [x] **No third-party copyrighted PDFs** - Removed 13MB of PDFs, added REFERENCES.md
- [x] **License file present** - MIT License added

## ‚úÖ High Priority (RESOLVED)

- [x] **README.md exists and is complete** - Auto-generated from README.org
- [x] **Dependencies documented** - Added DEPENDENCIES.md
- [x] **VG dependency accessible** - Verified at https://github.com/iskur/vg

## ‚úÖ Medium Priority (RESOLVED)

- [x] **CHANGELOG.md present** - Version 0.1.0 documented
- [x] **CONTRIBUTING.md present** - Guidelines for contributors
- [x] **Code quality issues** - Minor flake8 issues remain but non-critical
- [x] **Test configuration** - Removed auto --pdb flag
- [x] **.gitignore comprehensive** - Updated to exclude all personal/large files

## ‚ùå Critical Blockers for PyPI Publication

- [ ] **VG must be published to PyPI** - Currently only available via git
  - **Status:** Planned for future publication
  - **Impact:** WeatherCop cannot be published to PyPI until VG is on PyPI
  - **Reason:** PyPI does not allow git-based dependencies
  - **Workaround:** Users can install from GitHub using pip with git URL

## üìã Pre-Publication Verification

```

### Code Quality
- [x] No hardcoded personal paths
- [x] Environment variable configuration working
- [x] Import statements cleaned up
- [x] Cython extensions buildable
- [ ] All tests passing (known issues documented)

### Documentation

- [x] Usage examples provided
- [x] Troubleshooting section added
- [x] Dependencies fully documented
- [x] Academic references provided
- [x] Contribution guidelines written
- [x] PyPI blocker prominently documented

### Security & Privacy
- [x] No personal email addresses
- [x] No authentication tokens

- [x] No personal data paths
- [x] No internal network references

### Legal & Licensing

- [x] Third-party content properly attributed
- [x] Copyright notices appropriate
- [x] No third-party PDFs in repository

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Documented)

These are documented in CHANGELOG.md and README.md:

1. **First import delay** - 5-10 minutes for Cython compilation (documented in README)
2. **Test failures** - Some known failures with non-Gaussian marginals (marked as known issues)
3. **Minor code style** - Trivial flake8 violations (line length in comments, whitespace)

## üöÄ GitHub Publication Steps

### 1. Final Review
- [ ] Review all commits in `cleanup-for-release` branch
- [ ] Verify no sensitive information leaked
- [ ] Check README.md renders correctly on GitHub

### 2. Merge to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge cleanup-for-release
```

### 3. Tag Release
```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial public release"
git push origin main --tags
```

### 4. Create GitHub Release
- Go to GitHub Releases
- Create new release from v0.1.0 tag
- Copy relevant sections from CHANGELOG.md
- **Prominently mention VG PyPI blocker and installation from GitHub**

### 5. Post-Publication
- [ ] Test installation from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/iskur/weathercop.git`
- [ ] Verify README displays correctly
- [ ] Check that documentation links work
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## üìù PyPI Publication Requirements

**Before WeatherCop can be published to PyPI:**

1. **VG must be published to PyPI** (BLOCKER)
   - VG is currently only available via GitHub
   - PyPI does not allow git dependencies in packages
   - Once VG is on PyPI, update pyproject.toml to use PyPI version
   - Then WeatherCop can be submitted to PyPI

2. Update installation instructions to remove git dependency notes

3. Consider these improvements:
   - Address remaining flake8 violations
   - Improve test coverage
   - Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Create RTD documentation
   - Performance benchmarks

## ‚úÖ Ready for GitHub Publication

**GitHub Status:** READY ‚úì
**PyPI Status:** BLOCKED (waiting for VG on PyPI)

All critical and high-priority issues for GitHub publication have been resolved. The repository is clean, documented, and ready for public release on GitHub.

**Installation will be via:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/iskur/weathercop.git
```

**NOT available via:**
```bash
pip install weathercop  # Will NOT work until VG is on PyPI
```
